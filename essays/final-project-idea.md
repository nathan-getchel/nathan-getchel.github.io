## Overview

People who play board games know how hard it can be to find a group that consistently meets on time and stays together. Scheduling issues, flakey group members, and lack of communication are like a plague. Imagine if there were an easier way to find groups and scedule sessions! The tentatively named "Boardgame Coordinator" is a web application that would allow users to select their specific interests and see open groups whose interests match, with games like in-depth tabletop role-playing games to poker and anything in between.

## Mockup Page Ideas

- Landing page
- Login/signup page
- Interests/games list for users to select
- List of open groups
- Page to create a new group

## Use Case Ideas

- New user goes to page and signs up for an account
- Existing user logs in, scrolls through a list of groups that can be joined, and requests to join a group
- Existing user logs in and decides to create a new group with selected games/interests relevant to them

## Beyond the Basics

- Integration with calendar software (i.e. click a button to import an event into your Google calendar)
